I am a freelance consultant from Greece, specialized in WordPress development and Information Architecture. I hold a Masters degree in Cultural Policy, Management and Communication and a Bachelors degree in Communication, Media and Culture, both from Panteion University of Athens.

After working for a while as a journalist, I became a consultant specialized in Information Architecture of websites, portals and web applications. Over the last few years I shifted almost exclusively on developing websites, themes and plugins in WordPress.
